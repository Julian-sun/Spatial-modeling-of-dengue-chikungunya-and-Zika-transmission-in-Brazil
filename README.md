# Disease mapping of dengue chikungunya and Zika transmission in Brazilian municipalities

## Objective: 

This repository aims to provide the code used for spatial modeling of dengue, chikungunya and Zika. This work is separated into two steps:

  1. Data treatment and preparation;
  2. Coding the algorithm to estimate the spatial relative incidence risk of each of the diseases, for each Brasilian municipality. 

## Data treatment and preparation
